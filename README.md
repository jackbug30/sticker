# Sticker Stock Ticker

This is a stock ticker (built completely from scratch). Using 40 red/green 8x8 LED modules, custom PCBs, and an ESP32, it can display stock prices and changes.

By its nature of displaying test, it doesn't necessarily need to be a stock ticker. It could be used as a general text display (such as a clock).
